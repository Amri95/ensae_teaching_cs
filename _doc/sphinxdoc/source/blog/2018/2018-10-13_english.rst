    Most of the content is written in French.
    Two reaons for that, my teachings are in French,
    most of the content available on the internet
    is already in English. However, there exist some
    English content.
    A good start would be the lectures by
    `GaÃ«l Varoquaux <http://gael-varoquaux.info/>`_ :`.
    :ref:`l-ml-skgael`.
    I wrote some challenges in English one about algorithmic,
    the other one about unsupervized machine learning :
    `Computer Science Challenges <http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/ensae_projects/helpsphinx/i_challenges.html>`_.
    The main goal of this course is to introduce many 
    standard machine learning problems and play with them.
    I suggest doing one competition or study with a known
    datasets (:epkg:`Kaggle`, :epkg:`UCI`).
