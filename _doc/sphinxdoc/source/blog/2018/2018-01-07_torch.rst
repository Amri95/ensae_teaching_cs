    Saving and loading a :epkg:`pytorch` model is something
    which took me a couple of searches on internet so
    let's write it out. So to save a model:

    ::

        import torch
        model = create_model()  # create model
        train_model(model)      # something which trains a models
        torch.save(model.state_dict(), filename)

    To load it:

    ::

        import torch
        model = create_model()  # create model
        model.load_state_dict(torch.load(filename))

    These two snippets of code assume that there exists
    a function which creates the model structure.
    This comes from the fact :epkg:`pytorch` allows
    custom functions and they cannot be serialized
    with :epkg:`pickle`.
